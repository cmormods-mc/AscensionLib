/**
 * Decides which Pokemon of a battle act with which ranked effects (docs/BATTLE-ADAPTER-DESIGN.md, section 1). Pure: the
 * Cobblemon battle is described by {@link Actor}s, so every rule is a unit test with no Minecraft in reach.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>PvP</b>: nothing acts, ever.</li>
 *   <li><b>Everywhere but a dimension switched off</b>: a raid, an armed encounter, or a profile zone. Every dimension is a zone (tier 1 unless the
 *       configuration or a mod says otherwise); only a dimension set to tier 0 is native for both sides.</li>
 *   <li><b>A player's Pokemon</b> act from their stored profile; a Pokemon with no profile does not act.</li>
 *   <li><b>An armed encounter</b> (a tower opponent or floor boss, a raid boss) assigns its declared enemy snapshots, in
 *       order, to the non-player Pokemon, so what a Scouter revealed is what fights.</li>
 *   <li><b>A wild Pokemon or a trainer's Pokemon</b> (no armed encounter, not a raid) acts from its derived rating, the one a Scouter previews and
 *       a capture awards, at the zone's tier.</li>
