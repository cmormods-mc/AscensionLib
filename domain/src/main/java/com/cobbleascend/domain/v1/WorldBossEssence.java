/**
 * What a defeated CobbleRaids World Boss pays in Spooky Essence (docs/HALLOWEEN-EVENT-DESIGN.md). Pure: the damage each player dealt in, the essence
 * each earns out. The owner's rules (2026-10-25): a flat amount for everyone who took part, no cap on how many World Bosses one player can
 * earn from. A player took part when they dealt at least {@link #MIN_OF_AVERAGE} of the average damage per player, the same rule CobbleRaids uses
 * for its own Raid Points, so one reward never reaches a player the other skips. Relative to the average on purpose: a fixed share of the pool
 * would pay nobody once enough players split it evenly, and the event has no player cap.
