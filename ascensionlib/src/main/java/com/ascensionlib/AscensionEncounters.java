/**
 * The contract for a mod that owns an encounter (CobbleTowers, CobbleRaids) to let its players scout the enemies with a
 * Scouter. Signatures use only {@code java.*}, so a caller can reach it by reflection when the library is optional
 * for it (see {@link AscensionRewards}). Call on the server thread.
 *
 * <p>Declare every enemy the players may scout when the encounter starts, and call {@link #end} when it is over: a
 * Scouter reveals one enemy of one encounter and nothing outlives it. The encounter ID must be unique and never
 * reused, and must not contain {@code |}. Nothing declared here is ever a profile; the library only generates the
 * enemy's rarity and modifiers (from the ID, so a retry or a second declaration gives the same enemy) and shows
 * it once a player has spent a Scouter on it.
