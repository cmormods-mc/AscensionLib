 * The Halloween 2026 window as the pages see it (docs/HALLOWEEN-EVENT-DESIGN.md): it turns the spooky theme on and decides when the Haunting row shows
 * in the upgrade screen. The same window is the default of CobbleRaids' {@code world_boss.json}; Eastern time, written in UTC because the clocks change
 * on 1 November. Nothing here gates what a player may do: Spooky Essence and Hauntings stay usable after the event.
 *
 * <p>For a look before the 31st, start the server with {@code -Dascensionlib.halloween=true} (or {@code false} to force it off).
