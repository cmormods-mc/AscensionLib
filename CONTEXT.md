# AscensionLib — domain language

A turn-based Pokémon progression overhaul in which captures acquire potential, battles test builds, and crafting develops individual Pokémon. The mod is AscensionLib (mod ID `ascensionlib`); CobbleAscend was the working title and survives only in stored data names (the `<world>/cobbleascend/` directory, the `cobbleascend` Pokémon NBT keys) and the `com.cobbleascend` domain/store packages.

## Pokémon progression

**Ascension rarity**: The Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, or Mythical progression grade of an individual Pokémon. It is unrelated to a species being Legendary or Mythical.
_Avoid_: Species rarity, spawn rarity, power level.

**Affix**: A persistent, rolled modifier on one Pokémon that changes a defined aspect of battle performance.
_Avoid_: Enchantment, ability (which already has a Pokémon meaning).

**Prefix**: An offensive affix occupying one of the Pokémon's prefix slots.

**Suffix**: A defensive or recovery affix occupying one of the Pokémon's suffix slots.

**Affix family**: A group of mutually exclusive affixes that cannot coexist on the same Pokémon.

**Affix rank**: The quality band of an affix's numerical roll, advanced by spending milestone upgrades on its slot.
_Avoid_: Tier when referring to affix strength.

**Milestone upgrade**: A pending, Pokémon-specific choice earned at each ten-level milestone, spent to advance one selected affix slot by one rank.

**Pending upgrades**: Earned milestone upgrades that have not yet been assigned to affix slots.

**Ordinary affix slot**: A stable prefix or suffix position whose rank survives reforging; promotion unlocks additional positions.

**Unique affix**: A crafted, build-defining power occupying the Pokémon's single separate Unique slot, independent of ascension rarity and ordinary slot ranks.
_Avoid_: Seventh rarity, native ability.

**Unique classification**: The additional display designation of a Pokémon with an installed Unique affix, such as Rare · Unique.

**Promotion**: Permanent advancement by one ascension rarity, retaining existing affixes and unlocking an additional slot.

**Attunement**: Battle-earned progress toward the next promotion, tied to the individual Pokémon.
_Avoid_: Pokémon experience, friendship.

**Legacy Pokémon**: A Pokémon already owned when the overhaul is installed and lacking ascension data.

## Encounters and rewards

**Trial**: An overhaul-owned repeatable PvE challenge whose difficulty and rewards are declared before entry.

**Expedition**: A planned post-launch sequence of Trials with encounter modifiers and a final reward.
_Avoid_: Map (which also means a Minecraft item or world).

**Raid**: An encounter owned or executed by CobbleRaids, using its raid battle and shared-health rules.

**Encounter modifier**: A rule applied to an encounter, independent of an individual Pokémon's affixes.

**Reward entitlement**: A recorded right for one participant to claim the rewards for one completed encounter exactly once.

**Research stipend**: A small daily crafting-material reward for distinct species captured by a player.

## Crafting

**Resonance Dust**: The frequent crafting material consumed by rerolls and promotions.

**Facet**: The less frequent crafting material consumed by targeted reforging and higher promotions.

**Ascension Core**: The endgame crafting material consumed by Legendary and Mythical promotions.

**Unique Catalyst**: A scarce crafting material consumed to install or replace one selected compatible Unique affix.

**Unique fragment**: A slowly earned crafting material assembled into a Unique Catalyst.

**Reforge**: Replacing one selected ordinary affix with a newly rolled eligible affix and numerical value while preserving its slot rank and pending milestone upgrades.

**Refine**: Rerolling only the numerical value of one affix within its displayed range.

**Sealed reward**: An encounter reward committed to a claimable ledger before delivery.

## Scouting

**Scouter**: A one-use wallet material that reveals one chosen enemy's build for a single encounter. Obtained only as a CobbleTowers drop; it is spent only on a valid reveal.

**Reveal**: The in-memory disclosure of an enemy's level, types, base stats, rarity, Unique and modifiers (never IVs, EVs or moves). A boss reveal is shared with the whole party; any other reveal is for the user only. It ends with the encounter.

**Wild rating**: The rarity and slots of a wild Pokémon, derived from a server secret and the Pokémon's UUID so a preview equals the capture result and fleeing cannot reroll it.

## Storage and integration

**Wallet**: A player's account-bound balance of the crafting materials and the Scouter. There are no physical items.

**Progression store**: The per-world SQLite database that is authoritative for profiles, wallets and operations. The Pokémon's NBT is only a projection of its last committed revision.
_Avoid_: Save file, Pokémon data (as the source of truth).

**Authority**: The identity of one world's store, recorded in `authority.id`. A missing, mismatched or corrupt store disables progression instead of resetting it.

**Operation ID**: A caller-supplied key under which a mutation is recorded once. A repeated request returns the recorded result; the same ID with different parameters is rejected.

**Craft lock**: The persistent-data flag `ascensionlib_craft_locked` marking a lent Pokémon (such as a Towers rental). It can be inspected but not crafted.

**Profiler**: An opt-in timing aid, off by default, that logs screen and server-path timings.
