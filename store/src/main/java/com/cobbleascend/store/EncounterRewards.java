/**
 * Turns a finished encounter into wallet rewards exactly once. Raids, Towers and any later encounter owner decide
 * WHAT each participant earned (amounts are theirs and the economy's, never invented here) and call {@link #settle}
 * with the result; this class decides only WHETHER and guarantees the once.
 *
 * <p>Only a {@link EncounterOutcome#VICTORY} pays: defeat, abort and shutdown never do, and a missing or repeated
 * callback can neither lose nor duplicate a reward, because each payout is one store operation whose ID is derived
 * from {@code (encounterId, playerId, rewardKind)}. A retry after a crash completes whoever was not yet paid and
 * returns {@link Status#ALREADY_GRANTED} for the rest. Encounter IDs must be unique and never reused.
